# Hand Sign Detection System

This project implements a hand sign detection system using Python and OpenCV to recognize hand gestures from images and live webcam input.  
The system processes visual input, extracts relevant hand features, and classifies different hand signs using machine learning techniques.

## Features
- Real-time hand sign detection using webcam
- Image preprocessing and contour-based hand segmentation
- Machine learning–based gesture classification
- Modular and easy-to-understand project structure

## Tech Stack
- Python
- OpenCV
- NumPy
- Machine Learning (Scikit-learn)

## How It Works
1. Captures input from a webcam or image dataset  
2. Applies preprocessing techniques such as resizing, thresholding, and noise removal  
3. Extracts hand features using contour analysis  
4. Classifies hand signs using a trained ML model  

## Use Cases
- Human–computer interaction
- Gesture-based control systems
- Learning project for computer vision and ML fundamentals

## Future Improvements
- Improve accuracy with a larger dataset
- Add deep learning–based gesture recognition
- Support more hand signs and dynamic gestures
